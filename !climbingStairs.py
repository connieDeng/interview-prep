Going to Come back to this because this is a recursive/dynamic programming problem
- DYNAMIC PROG vs RECURSION: Dynamic programming is optimization of plain recursion
    when there is a recursive solution with repeated calls for same inputs --> optimize
    idea is to store results of subproblems so there is no need to recompute them when needed later
