comments
- Floyd's cycle detection algo: 1 slow pointer, 1 fast pointer; at different speeds they will meet at a certain point if there exist a cycle
- Brent's cycle detection algo: 1 stationary pointer, 1 fast pointer;
    - fast pointer moves in powers of 2 until loop is found
    - after every power, reset slow pointer to previous value of fast pointer
    - slow n fast pointer == means loop; fast pointer == None == no loop
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/brents-cycle-detection-algorithm/
- hash set works as well; if revisited node you know there is a loop
